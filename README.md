Let's create the skeleton of a web-based sudoku game, implemented as two web pages, a game page and a high scores page.

Dynamically build the game board, based on an array of integers (`1`-`9`, with `-1` being a special placeholder value representing empty cells).  Created the `<td>` elements, gave them a name (e.g. `cell21` for the cell in row 2, the third row, and column 1, the second column), so that it is easy to lookup.
